      * purpose: Examples of using various forms of the ACCEPT...FROM...
      *
      *          For this example program, I have every accept being stored
      *          in a generic x(50) variable. These can be broken down as
      *          needed on a case by case basis.
      *
      *          Ex FROM DATE could instead use:
      *
      *            accept ws-current-date from date
      *
      *          Variable declaration:
      *
      *            01  ws-current-date.
      *                05  ws-current year      pic 99.
      *                05  ws-current-month     pic 99.
      *                05  ws-current-day       pic 99.
